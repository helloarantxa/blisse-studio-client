      <p>When I started Ever After at the young age of 19, I knew that one thing would always be present in my work, passion. As a child of immigrant parents, I understood that an opportunity to start a business was a luxury. With a desire to show my parents their hard work did not go unnoticed, I effectively ran a local flower shop servicing thousands of wire orders for 1-800-Flowers, Teleflora, and FTD. In 2012, we began to focus heavily on our event division. Currently, we have completed over 1,000 events to date. I take pride in our tireless efforts to grow Ever After into the shop it has become.</p>

      <p>On a personal note, my background is in ballet. I believe the fluid movements inspire my organic flower arrangements. My home life is another huge source of inspiration and drive for me. As a mother of two young women, I know that my impact on their lives is greatly influenced by my resilience and ability to have a genuinely fulfilling career. Another motivation for my desire to see my clients live their happiest lives is my own happiness. My husband is my happiness. Finding your soulmate is a truly wonderful experience. Celebrating your love should be an equally amazing moment.</p>
